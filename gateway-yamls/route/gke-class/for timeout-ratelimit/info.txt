Configure Cloud Armor for Security Policy
Define a security policy for rate limiting and other security features using Google Cloud Armor:

Create Security Policy:
###gcloud compute security-policies create service1-security-policy --description "Security policy for service1"
###gcloud compute security-policies create service2-security-policy --description "Security policy for service2"

Add Rules for Rate Limiting:
###gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 --security-policy service1-security-policy --expression "origin.ip == '0.0.0.0/0'" --action "throttle" --rate-limit-threshold-count 100 --rate-limit-threshold-interval 60s
###gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 --security-policy service2-security-policy --expression "origin.ip == '0.0.0.0/0'" --action "throttle" --rate-limit-threshold-count 100 --rate-limit-threshold-interval 60s



Summery
GatewayClass: Defines the class of the gateway.
Gateway: Handles incoming HTTPS traffic and manages SSL/TLS.
HTTPRoute: Routes traffic to the appropriate services with specified paths and handles timeouts.
BackendConfig: Manages backend service configurations like timeouts, connection draining, and rate limiting.
Service Annotations: Associates services with BackendConfig.
Cloud Armor: Configures security policies for rate limiting.


also do that
add annotation to http route (example in route-http.yaml (namespace2) )
add 2 more annotation to service (example in example-service.yaml (namespace2) )
